### Time to Complete
- I started the project on October 30th at 12 PM. On the first day, I worked for 6 hours; 
- On the second day, I worked for 7 hours; 
- On the third and last day (November 1st), I worked for 4 hours. I 'finished' (to the best of my ability).
- Total time spent on the project: 17 hours.

### Research Process
I started by reviewing the design in Figma, analyzing each component and animation. Then, I searched for references on other e-commerce pages to understand how to implement similar interactions, such as the carousel. I used Lucide React to source the icons.

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- CSS
- Figma
- Lucide React
- Vercel

### Additional: Experience Evaluation
I enjoyed the experience of this test. It was my first time doing something like this for a company within such a short timeframe (72 hours), and I realized that I still have a lot to learn about React. I would like to express my gratitude to Tulfa for providing me with the opportunity to showcase my skills in React. This experience has motivated me to further develop my knowledge and expertise in this area, and I appreciate the chance to contribute in this test.
